      '2 tbsp olive oil or butter',

    instructions: [
      'Prep your vegetables: Wash all the produce. Dice the zucchini into small cubes, halve the cherry tomatoes, and set aside a small handful of fresh spinach leaves.',
      'Whisk the eggs: In a medium bowl, crack the eggs and add the milk. Season with a pinch of salt and a few cracks of black pepper. Whisk with a fork until the yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly frothy. Set aside.',
      'Sauté the zucchini: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil (or butter for extra flavor). Once hot, add the diced zucchini. Cook for 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly golden around the edges.',
      'Add tomatoes and spinach: Toss in the halved cherry tomatoes and stir. Cook for about 1 minute to warm them through and release their juices. Add the spinach last — it will wilt quickly in about 30 seconds to 1 minute.',
      'Add eggs and scramble gently: Lower the heat to medium-low. Pour the whisked eggs evenly into the skillet over the veggies. Let them sit for 10–15 seconds, then gently stir with a silicone spatula. Continue stirring slowly in a circular motion, scraping the bottom of the pan. You want soft curds — not dry eggs — so remove from heat while they\'re still slightly glossy.',
      'Add finishing touches: Sprinkle in a little cheese if using, and stir gently to melt. Garnish with fresh chopped herbs if desired.',
      'Serve warm: Plate up with toasted sourdough, avocado slices, or a sprinkle of chili flakes if you like a little heat.'

      'Combine wet and dry: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir gently with a wooden spoon or spatula just until combined — a few small lumps are okay! Overmixing will make the pancakes tough instead of fluffy.',
      'Let the batter rest (optional but helpful): Let the batter sit for 5–10 minutes while you heat your pan. This gives the flour time to hydrate and helps make the pancakes even lighter.',
      'Heat your pan: Place a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil and swirl to coat. You\'ll know it\'s ready when a drop of water sizzles on contact.',
      'Cook the pancakes: Use a ¼ cup measuring scoop to pour batter into the pan. Cook for about 2–3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set. Flip carefully and cook for another 1–2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.',
      'Keep warm (optional): Transfer cooked pancakes to a plate and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel or keep them warm in a low oven (around 90°C / 200°F) while you cook the rest.',
